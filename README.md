# HR-ANALYTICS
This is the project based on Job Offer Vs Acceptance of the candidates
There is an ever-increasing focus on effective recruitment. An organization invests a lot of its time and resources in search of the potential candidates. The investment become loses if the selected candidates do not join the organization in the end.
I have used various matchine learning algorithms to get the best fit model.
The algorithm which is selected after analysing multiple algos is Decision tree.
then i have used shiny web development for the deployment of the project.
the application work as follows:
first we need to upload the training data in to the application in order to build the model.
then in the second step we need to upload the test data in the application to predict the result.
the predicted result will be saved in the csv formate automatically.
